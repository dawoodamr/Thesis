\begin{abstract}
Kernel contraction is an interesting problem that can be used as a step towards belief revision. Kernels were introduced as a tool to determine why a given belief is accepted by the knowledge base. The aim of using kernels is to invalidate the reasons why that given belief is accepted, and hence rejecting it. In this study we will explain what kernels are and how we can use them to contract beliefs in an $\mathcal{EL}$ TBox. We will introduce some algorithms that perform belief contraction in different ways, and investigate the complexity of each of them. We will discuss the rationality of belief contraction by applying the rules introduced in the AGM framework.
