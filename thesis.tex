%   PACKAGES AND CUSTOMIZATIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages or custom commands you need for your thesis here.
%   You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called in
%   the sfuthesis class file:
%
%   - appendix
%   - etoolbox
%   - fontenc
%   - geometry
%   - lmodern
%   - nowidow
%   - setspace
%   - tocloft
%
%   If you call one of the above packages (or one of their dependencies) with
%   options, you may get a "Option clash" LaTeX error. If you get this error,
%   you can fix it by removing your copy of \usepackage and passing the options
%   you need by adding
%
%       \PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}
%
%   before \documentclass{sfuthesis}.
